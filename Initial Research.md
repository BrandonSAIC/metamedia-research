	Online or digital segregation is the segregation of people on the Internet, this segregation is usually done on racial and economic lines. 
	
    Digital segregation is a topic that I didn’t think would be so broad but there are a fair amount of people talking about the inequalities that are being sown into the technologies that we use every day. Some notable people are Safiya Noble who wrote a book called Algorithms of Oppression and it’s about the way search engines reinforce racist views and Virginia Eubanks who wrote Automated inequality which talks about how digital tracking and automated decision making can hurt poor people and minorities.
 	
    What I’m researching isn’t a specific technology so kind of hurt to a specific timeline for digital segregation but I did find one cool thing. Safiya Noble was able to change the first search for “black girls” on google to be sites for black women and news about black women instead of having it show adult sites.
