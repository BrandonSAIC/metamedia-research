Filter bubbles are caused by the technologies used to personalize the content you see on the web this can range from search results to the friends you see on facebook and the kinds of ads you see. Filter bubbles are there to get you to see content that you want but it allows you to get stuck into a point of view  with no real way of noticing it because you arenâ€™t shown what content has been filtered out.
